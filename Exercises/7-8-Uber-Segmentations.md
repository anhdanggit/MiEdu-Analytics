With any dataset that you can collect in [[3-Hypothesis-Car-Service]] (If you need, further data could be collected to conduct this exercise):

1. Compute RFM or any variants of RFM (See: [[7-8-Segmentation]])
2. Report the descriptives for each factor
3. Compute the Customer Score (3-digits). Based on RFM scores, split dataset into any meaningful segments
4. Analyze and report the insights for each RFM-based segments
5. Conduct the k-Means algorithsm on RFM factors in (1)
6. Analyze and report the insights for each RFM-kMeans segments
