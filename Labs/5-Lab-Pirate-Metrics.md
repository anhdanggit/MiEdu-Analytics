## AARRR Dashboard
The Pirate Metrics Framework in [[5-Analytics Frameworks]] is popular for early stage startups and many tech companies. In this lab, we will consider some examples.

### Discussion
For the dashboard below:
![[lab5.1.png]]

1. What metrics are presented?
2. Classify metrics into AARRR framework
3. What the business is it?

### Information and where it come from?
- `Acquisition`: Sessions on websites, signups (from [Google Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Analytics))
- `Activation`: Conversion Rates for key parts of the user journey (from [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/))
- `Retention`: Retention rate after two weeks in trial (number of users still active / number of user trial) (from [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/))
- `Referral`: Net Promoter Score (from [Delighted](https://delighted.com/))
- `Revenue`: Monthly Revenue (from internal database)

## AARRR for Tinder
![[lab5.2.png]]

### Discussion
> What metrics you will propose for Tinder, following AARRR framework? 

### Acquisition
> Where the users come from?
- Channel: Facebook/Instagram Ads, Snapchat, Gooogle Search, Appstore Search
- Each channel will have conversions and performance metrics (See: Marketing KPIs [[4-Lab-Metrics]])
	- `CPC` - Cost per Click
	- `CPM` - Cost per 1000 impressions
	- `ROI` - Return on investment = (profit - cost)/cost (account for any cost relates to the marketing effort)
	- `ROAS` - profit / advertising spendings
- Acquisition Funnel metrics
	- `CTR` - Click Through Rate
	- `Downloads`/`Clicks`
	- `Registrations`/ `Downloads`

> Discussion: How to improve these metrics

### Activation
> When does the user understand the value of tinder? 
- Some options: get the mutual match with someone, exchange messages
- Metrics:
	- Number of mutual matches per user
	- Number of dialogs


### Retention
> How to keep user return to the app (that we can generate revenue from them?)
- Metrics: 
	- `Retention Rate`: % of people return on 1st, 7th and 30th day after install
	- `Stickiness`: how many days a week people use the app

### Revenue 
> How the app make money?
- Tinder is free, but to have more benefits (unlimited likes, reveal more information, show the profile on spotlifht), users can buy packages: `Tinder Plus`, `Tinder Gold`
- Metrics:
	- `ARPD`: Average Revenue per Day
	- `ARPDAU`: Average Revenue per Daily Active User -> `Daily Active` View (combine old and new user, regradless their install/register day)
	- `LTV`: Life Time Value (value a user generate from Day0 through out their life cycle) -> `Cohort` view (separate by their install/register day - Day0) -> `LTV365` is the expected value from Day0 to 1 year after

## Discussion
- Choose any business and design their Pirate Metrics
- **Optional (if have time)**: 
	- [5 Lean Canvas Example of Multi-Billion Startups](https://railsware.com/blog/5-lean-canvas-examples/)
	- [Video: Lean Canvas - Uber Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvIN9STpzCQ)
	- Choose any business and apply the lean canvas for them

## Recap
1. Demonstrate how Pirate Metrics framework is applied in reality, via a Dashboard of AARRR
2. AARRR in Tinder as the example
