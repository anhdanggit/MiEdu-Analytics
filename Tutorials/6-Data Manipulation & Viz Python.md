## Data Distribution
- How spread apart is the data, and where the center of the data lies in terms of both the weight numerical values, and the raw number of data points?
	- **Standard deviation**: the measure of how dispersed (wide) a dataset is
	- **One standard deviation from the mean**: 68% of all values fall by this range both below and above the mean
	- **Two standard deviation from the mean**: 95% of all values fall by this range both below and above the mean
	- **Median**: Midpoint of a frequency distribution
	- **Average** - Also known as mean, the value of the central point in a dataset based on the weight other values
	- **Long tail distribution** - When a distribution has large number of occurrences that are relatively far from the median of the distribution
