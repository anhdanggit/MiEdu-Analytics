Besides the techniques of Segmentation as in in [[7-8-Segmentation-Analysis]], we can uncover the customer behavior by Cohort Analysis. 

While segmentation shows us the patterns across different subgroups in customer characteristics, cohort analysis provide us with customer behavior overtime. 

## What's cohort?
- *A cohort*: Individuals have some common in characteristics when we start observing (often based on the start date)
	- For example, users acquired through a same marketing campaign at the same date
	- First batch of students of an online course
- Cohort analysis is a useful way to compare groups of entities over time
	- Provide a framework to ==detect correlations between cohort characteristics and long-term trends== -> Hypotheses about the causal drivers.
	- Compare new cohorts of customers and compare to previous cohorts -> Alerts when something has gone wrong

> - Cohort is a grouping of users who have a common in starting dates, and being follower over time
> - Segments is a grouping of users who share a common characteristics at a point in time, regardless their starting date

## Components of Cohort Analysis
- Cohort analyses have three components
	1. `Cohort grouping`: often based on the start date (customer's first purchase, subscription date, the date a student started school, etc.)
	2. Time series of data over which a cohort is observed: 
		- A series of purchases, logins, interactions, Active Time Spent day-by-day after the start date
		- A series should cover the the entire life span (mature) 
		- A series should be long enough to complete the action of interest -> For example, if customers tend to purchase once a month, a time series of several months is needed. If, on the other hand, purchases happen only once a year, a time series of several years would be preferable.
		- Period is relative to the start date (for example, day0, day1, day2, etc.)
	3. Aggregate metrics that we want to measures: Retention, Revenue along the life-cycle. Any metrics that matters to the health of the business -> Aggregate `sum`, `count`, `average`

## Types of Cohort Analysis
### Retention
![[tutorial9.1.png]]
- Concern if a cohort member has a record in the time series on a particular date after the starting date (for example, go to the app at day30 after start date)
- Useful for the business model in which repeated actions are expected (playing online game, use app or product, renew subscription) -> To answer questions about how sticky and engaging a product is

### Survivorship
![[tutorial9.2.png]]
- Concern how many customers reamined for a certain length og time or longer, regardless of number or frequnecy of actions up to that time
- Useful to answer the questions about the proportion of the population that can be expected to remain - no churning (good), not graduating (bad)

### Returnship
- Concern if an action has happened more than some minimum threshold of time for a fixed window of time
- Helpful in which the behavior is intermittent and unpredicatble, such as in retail

### Cumulative - LTV
![[tutorial9.3.png]]
- Concern with the total number of amount measure over a fixed time windows, regardless of when they happened during that window
- Use to calculate LTV (Life-time value) -> LTV60 means the cumulative revenue generated by a customer from day0 to day60.

> These types of cohort analysis allow us to compare subgroups and understand how their behavior differ over time, to make better product, marketing, and finance decision
